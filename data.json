  "summary_en": "The author suggests that the historical human-cat relationship is a case study in how a \"shoggoth\" (evolutionary pressure or intelligence) aligned humans not to its own interests, but to those of cats themselves. He uses this as an existence proof that alignment of higher intelligences to lower ones is possible. The proposal is to try to recreate or learn this alignment process (via data, genome sequencing, etc.), both scientifically and as an approach in AI alignment, ultimately as a way to ensure that intelligences which surpass us might still protect things we care about (as cats are cared for).",
  "summary_zh": "作者提出，人类与猫的历史关系是一个范例（case study），说明一种“修格斯”（shoggoth，即进化压力或某种智能体）并不是将人类对齐到自己的效用函数，而是让人类去对齐猫。这个关系证明了：高等智能体可以被对齐（alignment）去尊重比自己低级的存在的价值。作者提议我们可以尝试重现或学习这个对齐过程——例如通过猫的基因测序、古猫种群重建、AI 学习猫的效用函数等——既是科学研究，也是 AI 对齐的一种路径，最终目的是在未来有更强智能体出现时，能有机制使其保护我们所看重的事物，就像人类现在照顾猫一样。",
  "best_quote_en": "Aligning an intelligence to humans is hard, maybe even impossible. The true desires of a human being may not even be a well defined concept! On the other hand, aligning an unbounded, recursively improving intelligence to cats is boundedly hard because it’s already been done once.",
  "best_quote_zh": "将某种智能体对齐到人类可能非常困难，甚至不可能。人的真实欲望可能根本不是一个明确定义的概念！但另一方面，将一个递归自改进、无限的智能体对齐到猫，则是有界难度的 —— 因为这件事我们已经做过一次了。"
